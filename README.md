This project is an electronic door locking system using an Arduino UNO, where access is granted upon entering the correct password via a 4x4 keypad. The lock/unlock status is visually displayed on a 16x2 LCD display, and a servo motor acts as the locking mechanism. The system also includes a delay lockout mechanism after a wrong password is entered
